		{{site.sb-s}}, <!--Views-->
		{{site.tp}} General <!--Telerik Platform-->
	</td>

    <td>Hybrid ({{site.ac}} app)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Description

By adding a support for more languages than the default language of your app you can make it usable for more users. 

The {{site.sb-s}} service in {{site.tp}} already provides a way to do so in the generated code for newly-created apps. The procedure for doing so in a project generated via the {{site.sb-s}} service is explained in [Implement Multi-Lingual Support](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/screenbuilder/troubleshooting/localization). 

Refer to the solution below if you would like to update your existing app with intebrationalization support and/or use an approach outside of the {{site.sb-s}} service. 
 
## Solution

Consult the steps below for an example approach how to implement an internationalization support for your hybrid app built with {{site.tp}} and Kendo Hybrid UI. 

1. Create a variable (or a file) that contains a mapping for the static strings and texts used in your app for the different languages you would like to support. For instance, an object containing a few strings to be used for either English or Bulgarian language support in the app:

	```
	app.strings = {
	    en: {
	        name: "English",
	        homeHeader: "Welcome",
	        homeTitle: "Home",
	        homeLangButton: "Switch Language"
	    },
	    bg: {
	        name: "Bulgarian",
	        homeHeader: "Добре дошли",
	        homeTitle: "Начало",
	        homeLangButton: "Смени езика"
	    }
	};
	``` 

2. Iterate over your application views and set one of the language sets as default. You can also use the `changeLanguage` function to allow the user switching the language. 

	```
	'use strict';
  
	app.home = kendo.observable({
	    onShow: function() {},
	    afterShow: function () { },
	    lang: app.strings.en,
	    changeLanguage: function () {
	        var currentLanguage = this.get("lang").name;
	  
	        if (currentLanguage == "English") {
	            this.set("lang", app.strings.bg);
	        }
	        else {
	            this.set("lang", app.strings.en);
	        }
	    }
	});
	```

3. Make sure to bind the required elements in your views to the provided string values. For example, the following markup is binding the header title, a header of the page and a button to the localized strings. 

	```
	<div data-role="view" data-layout="main" data-model="app.home" 
	    data-init="app.home.onInit" data-show="app.home.onShow" data-after-show="app.home.afterShow" 
	    id="homeScreen" class="screen">
	    <header data-role="header">
	        <div data-role="navbar">
	            <h2 data-bind="text: lang.homeTitle"></h2>
	        </div>
	    </header>
	    <h2 data-bind="text:lang.homeHeader"></h2>
		<a data-role="button" data-bind="events: {click: changeLanguage}">
	    	<span data-bind="text: lang.homeLangButton"></span>
	    </a>
	</div>
	``` 

## Notes 

You can also use the methods of the [Cordova Globalization](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/cordova/using-plugins/using-core-plugins/using-core-plugins) Core Plugin to detect the device culture. According to the detected device language set programmatically which set of strings to be used in your application.
