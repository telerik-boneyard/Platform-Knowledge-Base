<!-- Environment Table -->
<!-- TO DO:
     We need to check how such can be developed according to our needs:
 	 We don't need Header roll, but rather a title: Environment.
     E.g. - Telerik Product, Version, SDK, SDK version, Mobile OS Vendor, Mobile OS Vendor Version, Client, Client Version, App Type (Hybrid/NativeScript/Native), 3rd party integration, Browser Type, Browser Version -->

## Description
<!-- Mandatory -->
State the question.

* Use complete thoughts.
* Use words and phrases the customer used to describe the issue (even if technically inaccurate). This, as well as providing technical details and keywords benefits higher indexing of the article among Google searches. 
* If possible restate the problem in technical wording. This increases the ability to find the article for internal staff.
* Add factual statements that clarify the issue.  These are facts that will not change when the issue is resolved.
Information or troubleshooting steps that bring clarity to the issue but are not part of the actual problem.

## Steps to Reproduce
<!-- Optional -->
<!-- TO DO: Decide which name suits better -->
Environment information that is not listed in the Environment section of the article.
Clarifying information that does not go in the Problem Description or Error Message.

Steps to reproduce an issue are required if:

* we can identify clean path of reproducing the faulty behavior 
* do not require customer proprietary code

TSEs should supply steps to reproduce the issue when available.

## Error Message
<!-- Optional -->
List the exact error message(s) pertaining to the issue.
Remove any customer-specific information from the error message, such as product names or file names.

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)
<!-- Mandatory -->
Describe the underlying (root) cause of the problem in customer-consumable language.  Use discretion for proprietary information.
Customers value this information as it:

* Helps confirm that the resolution is relevant to their issue.
* Builds their confidence that the solution is proven and understood. 

If the root cause is not known use the standard statement:  
<!-- TO DO: We need to come up with proper statement, or use this? -->
"The exact cause is not known at this time."

<!-- TO DO: Add examples as at some stage. E.g.:
        The exact cause is not known at this time.
        This is expected behavior. <add concise description of why it is expected>
        The schema used by the ODBC DataServer for the SQL database no longer matches the actual schema of the SQL database. -->


## Solution
<!-- Mandatory -->
Provide information about resolving the issue. Use bullets or numbered steps, if applicable. The solution is used when we are sure that certain steps cover\solve the whole issue and they follow the best approach we are aware of for that purpose. If no clean resolution is available we must insert the introductory sentence which states that there is no solution and then, have at least one **Possible Workaround** below.

E.g.: There is no clean solution for [this]. Please check the suggested workaround(s) below for further assistance.
